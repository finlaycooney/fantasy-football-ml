Plan

Project: Fantasy Premier League AI Team Predictor
This plan outlines the steps to build a data-driven application that recommends an optimal Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team. We'll start with a core Python engine and then discuss how to wrap it in a web application.

Phase 1: The Core Engine (Data & Prediction)
Objective: Create a Python script that suggests the best possible 15-player squad for the next gameweek.

Key Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Requests, PuLP.

Step 1: Define Your Goal - What Are You Predicting?
Before writing any code, decide on your model's target. Are you predicting:

Total points for the next gameweek? (Most common)

Points per million £? (Value metric)

Likelihood of a "haul" (10+ points)? (High-risk, high-reward)

Let's assume we're predicting total points for the next gameweek.

Step 2: Data Acquisition
You need good data. The most crucial source is the official FPL API.

Endpoint: https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/

What it contains: A massive JSON file with player info (points, cost, team, position), team data, and gameweek data.

Action: Write a Python script using the requests library to fetch and save this JSON data.

For more advanced features (known as "feature engineering"), you'll want more data sources:

Fixture Data: You need to know who is playing whom. The API has this.

Team Strength: Data on which teams are strong offensively/defensively. You can derive this from past results or use betting odds APIs.

Historical Player Data: Use sources like fbref.com (can be scraped using BeautifulSoup and pandas) for detailed historical player performance (xG, xA, etc.).

Step 3: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
This is the most critical and time-consuming part. You'll use the pandas library heavily.

Load Data: Load the JSON from the API into a pandas DataFrame.

Create Features: The raw data isn't enough. You need to create features (columns) that the model can learn from. Examples:

form: A player's average points over the last 5 games.

points_per_million: total_points / now_cost.

fixture_difficulty: Use the team strength data to rate a player's upcoming opponent.

home_advantage: A binary flag (1 for home, 0 for away).

Lag features: A player's points, minutes played, goals, etc., from the previous gameweek.

Step 4: Model Selection & Training

Choose a Model: Start simple. A Gradient Boosting Regressor (like XGBoost or LightGBM) or a RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn are excellent choices for this kind of tabular data. They are powerful and robust.

Prepare Data for Training:

Your X variable will be your DataFrame of features for all players for all past gameweeks.

Your y variable will be the total_points a player scored in their next game.

Train the Model: Train your chosen model on all the historical data.

# Example
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Predict for the Future: Use the trained model to predict points for every player for the upcoming gameweek. You will now have a list of all players and their predicted points.

Step 5: Optimization (The "Knapsack Problem")
You can't just pick the top 15 players with the highest predicted points; you have a budget (£100m) and formation constraints (2 GKs, 5 DEFs, 5 MIDs, 3 FWDs; max 3 players per team).

This is a classic optimization problem. The best tool for this in Python is the PuLP library.

Define the Problem: Tell PuLP you want to maximize the total predicted points.

Define the Variables: Each player is a binary variable (either in the team or not).

Define the Constraints:

sum(player_cost) <= 100.0

sum(goalkeepers) == 2

sum(defenders) == 5

sum(midfielders) == 5

sum(forwards) == 3

sum(players_from_team_X) <= 3 for each team X.

Solve: PuLP will solve this and give you the optimal 15-player squad that maximizes your predicted points while adhering to all the rules.

Phase 2: Building the Web Application
Objective: Create a web interface to display your model's recommendations.

Key Technologies: FastAPI (Python), Svelte/React (TS/JS), HTML/CSS.

Step 6: Backend API
Your Python script is great, but it's not a web service. You need an API.

Framework: Use FastAPI. It's modern, extremely fast, and integrates seamlessly with data science models.

Endpoints: Create a simple endpoint, e.g., /api/get-recommended-team.

Logic: When this endpoint is called, it should run your entire prediction and optimization pipeline (Steps 2-5) and return the final 15-player squad as a JSON object.

Step 7: Frontend Interface
This is where your JS/TS knowledge comes in.

Framework: Use a modern framework. Svelte is arguably the simplest to get started with, but React or Vue are also great choices.

UI: Design a simple page. It could have:

A "Generate Team" button.

A display area that shows the recommended players, perhaps laid out on a football pitch graphic.

Logic: When the button is clicked, use fetch in your JavaScript to call your FastAPI backend. Once you receive the JSON response, use it to populate the UI and display the team.

Phase 3: Deployment & Advanced Features
Deployment:

Backend: Deploy your FastAPI app using a service like Heroku, Render, or a small cloud VPS.

Frontend: Deploy your static web app using a service like Vercel or Netlify.

Advanced Ideas:

Automation: Set up a cron job (like GitHub Actions) to fetch new data automatically every day.

Database: Store past predictions and player data in a database (like PostgreSQL or SQLite) so you don't have to re-fetch everything every time.

User Accounts: Allow users to save their teams or track their performance.

Deeper Analysis: Show why a player was chosen (e.g., "High predicted points due to easy fixture and great form").
